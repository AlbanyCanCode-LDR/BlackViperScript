# Currently Testing (Read Notes)
Ability to save backup of service configuration as ".reg" instead of the script's ".csv" (or you can save as both)
--Havn't tested it much yet, so be warned it may not work right

# About Testing Version
If I am not working on a change or addition to the script, this will be the same exact copy as the non test.<br />
Only Differances between script are:
1. Version Check will download the 'Test' version instead of 'Stable' (if there is an update)
2. Display of a Warning message at 'TOS screen'
3. Error messages are shown (From all sources)
4. Error display may show various info for diagnostic purposes

**Note: Use the copy here if you dont mind possible bugs or problems.**<br />
**Note: Dont forget to download the file `BlackViper.csv` and `Update.bat` from the base folder**
